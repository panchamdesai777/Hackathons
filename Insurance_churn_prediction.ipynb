        "Insurance companies around the world operate in a very competitive environment. With various aspects of data collected from millions of customers, it is painstakingly hard to analyze and understand the reason for a customerâ€™s decision to switch to a different insurance provider.\n",
        "\n",
        "For an industry where customer acquisition and retention are equally important, and the former being a more expensive process, insurance companies rely on data to understand customer behaviour to prevent retention. Thus knowing whether a customer is possibly going to switch beforehand gives Insurance companies an opportunity to come up with strategies to prevent it from actually happening.\n",
